# TODO

 * Toolbar  is super wide on my setup (doesn't fit on the screen) (@capehill)
 * The convert button has the same shortcut like the Hyperlink. This triggers both. The menu item for Convert has the right shortcut (@walkero)
 * The settings Save button, IMO should propose the default name that earmark wait to load, giving the user the option to change it, if he wants. Or there should be a tooltype where the user should set the default config file. (@walkero)
 
*. Why do you include {} on code block? This stays as character by md4c on preview. I never used it with code blocks, but I might be wrong to be honest. (@walkero)
* Can the Save not work as "Save as...", showing the file requester? IMO, it should save over the file. (@walkero)
* If I make changes on the file, that are not saved, it would be nice to have something at the window title that shows that this file was edited. (@walkero) 
 * I don't know if you have this in your plans, but it would be good if there was a way to use always a specific browser and not open new tabs all the time. I am working on ideas on that, and I will be back with proposals. I guess a good candidate would be to use NetSurf, since it doesn't need to support Javascript. Which brings us maybe to a way to set if the user wants to use OpenURL (like it is now) or use ARexx to send the url to a specific browser. And let the user create it.(@walkero, @kas1e) 
 * Convert CRLF to LF on load (@trixie)


# DONE

---- 1.1

 * The table button bubble has a semicolon after the shortcut, instead of colon (@walkero)
 * RMB Quit option not working (@Capehill)
* If you mark a line and you choose bold, italic, etc.. then the editor adds the necessary markdown characters. The problem is that if that line starts/ends with space, then the markdown is broken, because md4c includes that space, and the asterisks are staying as characters. To be more precise

---- 1.0
1. Project menu both Load and Save have the same shortcut (@walkero) 
2. It would be good to have a shortcut for the Project > Update. It can be handy(@walkero)
8. Choices that open a new window, like adding a link, maybe it would be good to close after the user press OK.(@walkero)
4. In settings, "Allow blocks" and "Allow spans" have the same bubble help text(@walkero)
3. There is no way to save the Settings, if you do a change. They are not saved on window close, nor there are any buttons to do that.(@walkero)
6. If you start a new project, you cannot preview it. I guess because there is no way to run md4c while there is no file. Maybe create a new one only in Ram, and work with that.(@walkero)

# NOTHING TO DO

9. The last version includes Makefile and the project file from Codebench, which might not needed.

# TODO



 * The settings Save button, IMO should propose the default name that earmark wait to load, giving the user the option to change it, if he wants. Or there should be a tooltype where the user should set the default config file. (@walkero)
 
* Can the Save not work as "Save as...", showing the file requester? IMO, it should save over the file. (@walkero)
* If I make changes on the file, that are not saved, it would be nice to have something at the window title that shows that this file was edited. (@walkero) 
 * I don't know if you have this in your plans, but it would be good if there was a way to use always a specific browser and not open new tabs all the time. I am working on ideas on that, and I will be back with proposals. I guess a good candidate would be to use NetSurf, since it doesn't need to support Javascript. Which brings us maybe to a way to set if the user wants to use OpenURL (like it is now) or use ARexx to send the url to a specific browser. And let the user create it.(@walkero, @kas1e) 
 * Convert CRLF to LF on load (@trixie)


# DONE

---- 1.1
 * BUGFIX: The convert button had the same shortcut like the Hyperlink. 
(@walkero)
 * Added status bar gadget for showing current cursor position and whether the
 file has been changed. (@walkero)
 * Menu images added. 
 * Toolbar  is super wide on my setup (doesn't fit on the screen) (@capehill)
 * Added View and Insert menus
 * Fenced code blocks were automatically adding opening and closing braces 
(@walkero)
 * BUGFIX: The table button bubble had a semicolon after the shortcut, 
instead of a colon (@walkero)
 * BUGFIX: Menu Quit option was not working (@Capehill)
 * BUGFIX: If you marked a line and you choose bold, italic, *etc.* if that
 line started/ended with a space, then the markdown was broken, because 
md4c included that space, and the asterisks were staying as characters. 
*E.g.*
**this is a broken bold line, not translated by md4c ** 
** this is also a broken bold line, not translated by md4c**
 (@walkero)
* BUGFIX: The filename for converting to html was getting ".html" 
 appended upon each conversion.

 
---- 1.0
1. Project menu both Load and Save have the same shortcut (@walkero) 
2. It would be good to have a shortcut for the Project > Update. It can be handy(@walkero)
8. Choices that open a new window, like adding a link, maybe it would be good to close after the user press OK.(@walkero)
4. In settings, "Allow blocks" and "Allow spans" have the same bubble help text(@walkero)
3. There is no way to save the Settings, if you do a change. They are not saved on window close, nor there are any buttons to do that.(@walkero)
6. If you start a new project, you cannot preview it. I guess because there is no way to run md4c while there is no file. Maybe create a new one only in Ram, and work with that.(@walkero)

# NOTHING TO DO

9. The last version includes Makefile and the project file from Codebench, which might not needed.

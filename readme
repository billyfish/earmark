Type:         text/edit

Requires: dev/mui/MCC_TextEditor-15.55.lha, Launch-Handler

This is a tool to allow you to edit and view Markdown documents.  It uses a customised version of 
md4c at https://github.com/mity/md4c by Martin Mitas available to do the actual conversion of 
Markdown to HTML.

USAGE:

The window consists of two pages; an Editor page and a Settings page.

Editor:

The Editor page consists of a tool bar and a text editor gadget which is where the Markdown source
code will be shown .

You can either drag and drop a markdown file onto the window or use the "Load" button or menu item. 
This will load it into the editor gadge. You can make any changes in the editor that you want and click 
on the "Save" button or use the menu item to save your updated file. If you want to see how it looks, 
click on the "Update" button or menu item and the latest version of your file will get saved as an HTML 
file and you will be prompted to choose which Browser you wish to use to view it.

The toolbar also adds some basic buttons for setting a selection of text to be bold, italic or code. They
all work be highlighting some text and clicking them.

Settings:

On this page you can configure some of the options for converting the Markdown to HTML.

FUTURE:

Moving to an image-based toolbar too, adding more editing functionality and getting the buttons
to become selected for given bits of text, e.g. the bold button being highlighted when the cursor
is in a piece of bold text, etc. is next. 
Syntax highlighting would be nice too. Any other ideas are welcome. :-)

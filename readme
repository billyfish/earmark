This is a tool to allow you to edit and view Markdown documents.  It uses a customised version of 
md4c at https://github.com/mity/md4c by Martin Mitas available to do the actual conversion of 
Markdown to HTML.

USAGE:

The window consists of a tool bar and two gadgets; and editor gadget on the left which contains the 
markdown data and a viewer gadget on the right-hand side which displays the HTML generated from
the markdown data.

You can either drag and drop a markdown file onto the window or use the "Load" button or menu item. 
This will load it into the editor gadge. You can make any changes in the editor that you want and click 
on the "Save" button or use the menu item to save your updated file. If you want to see how it looks, 
click on the  "Update" button or menu item and the latest version of your file will get rendered into the 
viewer gadget.
 

FUTURE:

Currently the Markdown is parsed using the CommonMark specification and I plan to support the 
Github flavour too along with various other options such as allowing tables, task lists, strike through, 
etc. Moving to an image-based toolbar too is on the list as well as a toolbar for the editor to allow 
for a simple click to set some text as bold, italic, etc. Syntax highlighting would be nice too. Any 
other ideas are welcome. :-)
